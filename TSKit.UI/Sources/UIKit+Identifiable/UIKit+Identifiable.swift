     * Instantiates and returns the view controller of given `type` using that `type` as identifier.
     * You use this method to create view controller objects that you want to manipulate and present programmatically in your application.
     * - Note: This method creates a new instance of the specified view controller each time you call it.
     * - Parameter type: Type of the view controller to be instantiated.
     * - Important: Before you can use this method to retrieve a view controller, you must explicitly tag it with an identifier string matching view controller's type in Interface Builder.
     *
     *   ## Example:
     *   Let's assume you have following view controller:
     *   ```
     *   class ExampleViewController: UIViewController { }
     *   ```
     *   In order to instantiate it like this:
     *   ```
     *   storyboard.instantiateViewController(ofType: ExampleViewController.self)
     *   ```
     *   you should tag corresponding view controller in Interface Builder with identifier `ExampleViewController` in the `Storyboard` you are referencing to.
     * - Returns: The view controller of given `type`. If no view controller has matching indetifier, this method throws an exception.
